# unitycamera

A Unity app (built for iOS at the moment) that allows your device to use its back or front camera "in-game".

The process to build and run the app on a device is longer than it takes to write the script, but now we know :D

- Have an up to date version of Unity, Xcode, and Apple devices
- It is possible to run an app in development testing mode on a real device without a paid Apple developer account
